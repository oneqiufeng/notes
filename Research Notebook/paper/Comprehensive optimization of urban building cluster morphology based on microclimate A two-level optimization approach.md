# Comprehensive optimization of urban building cluster morphology based on microclimate: A two-level optimization approach

# Abstract

Building cluster morphology plays a crucial role in shaping urban microclimate. Due to the global warming and urban expansion, urban microclimate environment has encountered several problems, like extreme heat or cold stress events. The practical design of building clusters often involves multi-scale, multi-faceted problems and contradiction points which is always challenging to solve. This paper proposes a “two-level” optimization framework for the layout and form design of building clusters in the aspect of engineering applications. A case design project is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through detailed seasonal simulation. Results show that, comparing with the base case, the candidate design plan (i.e., Plan C) is attractive given the mean UTCI of the selected locations is lower by 0.73 ◦C in the cooling season noon and higher by 1.91 ◦C in the heating season at night. Results also indicate that the layout of a building cluster has greater impacts on the outdoor thermal environment during the heating season than the cooling season. Considering Plan C still has a heat/cold stress, further refinements have been performed on the local micro climate to adjust the wind corridor and solar radiation at the lower-level of architectural form. Finally, comprehensive design strategies have been synthesized for the building cluster design.

**建筑群形态对城市微气候的形成起着至关重要的作用**。

由于全球气候变暖和城市扩张，城市小气候环境遇到了一些问题，如极端的热或冷应激事件。

建筑群的实际设计往往涉及多尺度、多方面的问题和矛盾点，解决起来总是充满挑战。本文从工程应用的角度出发，提出了建筑群布局和形态设计的 "两级 "优化框架。

通过一个案例设计项目，详细的季节模拟证明了所提框架的有效性。结果表明，与基本方案相比，候选设计方案（即方案 C）具有吸引力，因为所选地点的平均 UTCI 在制冷季节中午降低了 0.73 ◦C，而在采暖季节夜间则升高了 1.91 ◦C。

结果还表明，建筑群的布局对采暖季室外热环境的影响大于制冷季。考虑到 C 规划仍存在冷热应力，我们对当地的小气候进行了进一步完善，以调整建筑形态下层的风走廊和太阳辐射。

最后，对建筑群设计进行了综合设计策略的归纳。
