# What goes into a Generative Design Process

# Stages

As previously discussed, a generative design approach allows for a more integrated workflow between human and computer. In Generative Design, this workflow involves the following stages: **generate, analyze, rank, evolve, explore, and integrate**.

正如前面所讨论的，生成式设计方法使人与计算机之间的工作流程更加一体化。在生成式设计中，这一工作流程包括以下阶段：_**生成、分析、排序、演化、探索和整合**_。

## Generate

The design options are created or generated by the system, using algorithms and parameters specified by the designer.

## Analyze

The designs generated in the previous step are now measured or analyzed based on how well they achieve goals defined by the designer.

## Rank

The design options are ordered or ranked based on the results of the analysis.

## Evolve

The process ranks the design options to figure out in which direction they should be further developed or evolved.

## Explore

The designer compares and explores the generated designs, inspecting both the geometry and evaluation results.

## Integrate

The designer chooses a favorite design option and integrates it into the wider project or design work.

# Anatomy of each stage

Each of these stages can be further broken down into _`define`_, _`run`_ and _`results`_ steps. The _`define`_ step is the responsibility of the designer, while the _`run`_ and _`results`_ steps are performed by the computer.

Using this breakdown, let's look at what the_`generate`_ stage would entail.

## Define

For the _`define`_ step, the designer will need to do the following:

- Establish the generation algorithm - this is the logic that defines how designs are generated, which may include things like constraints and rules.
- Provide the generation parameters - these are the variables or inputs needed for the previously-defined algorithm.

This _`define`_ step is present and vital for all stages of the generative design process, as the validity of outputs relies on the quality of the designer’s contribution in this step.

With clear and concise logic, the computer can provide suitable outputs.

## Run

Once everything is defined in the algorithm and its accompanying parameters, the computer begins to _`run`_, meaning it starts to generate different design options. This process might happen locally on the designer's computer or, for more intensive calculations, it may happen using cloud computing.

## Result

![[../../2023年/attachments/详解Result.webp]]

The things that are generated during the _`run`_ step are the final outputs from each stage. These are then used as inputs or parameters in subsequent phases.

For example, the designs created in the _`generate`_ phase will be used as one of input parameters in the _`analysis`_ phase.

## Overall Process

We can map these stages and steps together in a single diagram, allowing us to visualize the order of each stage and their dependencies.

The diagram shows us that:

- Each stage and step is dependent on the previous one.
- The entire study process is repeatable, as each iteration learns from the previous results.
