## 摘要：阅读思考

Sustainable road planning in the cities’ [[Built-Up]] areas strives to meet traffic demands of society within limited spaces available for construction and various constraints in the built environment considering engineering, traffic, economic, social, and environmental factors. **Unlike rural areas, road planning in the built environment can be significantly influenced by the surroundings, such as existing buildings, road network, and land use, and should consider noise and air pollution impact on residents.** In addition, road width and road widening are significant factors for road alignment planning. 

Based on the MCDM-GIS method, the least-cost wide path algorithm is employed for sustainable road alignment planning in the built environment, considering building demolition and land use, traffic congestion, noise impact, air pollution impact, and construction costs. Road width, new road construction, and existing road widening are considered simultaneously. Several methods are proposed to digitalize and parse various sustainable factors into understandable expressions for road alignment planning. Forbidden areas and road buffer areas for road widening are defined. The proposed method is implemented in road planning in Dartford, Kent County, UK. 

在[[MCDM-GIS]]方法的基础上，考虑到建筑拆迁和土地利用、交通拥堵、噪声影响、空气污染影响和建设成本，采用最小成本的宽路径算法来进行建筑环境中的可持续道路线形规划。道路宽度、新道路建设和现有道路拓宽同时被考虑。提出了几种方法，将各种可持续因素数字化并解析为可理解的表达，用于道路线形规划。定义了道路拓宽的禁区和道路缓冲区。提出的方法在英国肯特郡达特福德的道路规划中得到了实施。

Sustainable factors with different weights can generate various road alignments from different perspectives, and road widths can significantly and locally in­ fluence road alignments. 具有不同权重的可持续因素可以从不同的角度产生各种道路线形，而道路宽度可以显著地和局部地影响道路线形。

MCDM（Multiple Criteria Decision Making）多属性决策

**Result & Discussion**

There are ten alignment planning results, as shown in Figs. 27 and 28. All the alignments do not touch the forbidden areas and try to avoid widening A282 and A2 highways. For alignments considering traffic congestion, they try to go through the areas less distant from congested areas. There are some newly built sections and road widening sections. In the road widening section, the road is always on one side and tries to avoid occupying existing old roads because the sections occupying existing old roads represent the section without road widening or new road construction, which cannot help ease traffic congestion.

有十个对齐规划结果，如图所示。第27和28段。所有路线均不接触禁区，并尽量避免拓宽A282和A2高速公路。对于考虑交通拥堵（图27和图28中的（1）和（2））的路线，它们试图穿过距离拥堵区域较不远的区域。有一些新建路段和道路拓宽路段。在道路拓宽路段中，道路始终在一侧，尽量避免占用现有的旧道路，因为占用现有旧道路的路段代表没有道路拓宽或新道路建设的路段，无助于缓解交通拥堵。
