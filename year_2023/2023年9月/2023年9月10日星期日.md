## 【完成】UCL at Here East ScanLAB

ScanLAB Projects 由伦敦大学学院巴特利特学院的毕业生Matthew Shaw和William Trossell于 2010 年创立，专门探索大规模三维扫描在建筑和创意产业中的应用，同时还设计在线环境、沉浸式装置、物品和移动应用程序，已成为英国该领域的先锋机构。ScanLAB曾与全球领先的建筑师、广播公司、科学家和艺术家合作，专注于探索大规模三维扫描在建筑和创意产业中的应用。该实验室的工作从概念设计到现场扫描，再到产品交付，其扫描作品曾作为大型电视纪录片在电影院放映，相关项目资料在国际上广泛出版和展出。同时ScanLAB也是一家开创性创意工作室，通过将世界数字化，将临时空间的瞬间转化为引人入胜图像和电影的永久体验，并设计在线沉浸式环境，帮助人们身临其境。项目的主要工具（或媒介）是三维扫描，研究人员也认为它是摄影的未来且远不止于此。三维扫描将作为数十亿部手机和无人驾驶汽车的电子眼，同时它也是未来的制图师，通过对地点和事件进行批判性观察，我们将能窥见人类共同居住的未来发展方向。

ScanLAB Projects is an award winning creative studio. We specialise in exploring the use of large scale 3D scanning in architecture and the creative industries.

ScanLAB Projects is a pioneering creative practice.

We digitise the world, transforming temporary moments and spaces into compelling permanent experiences, images and film. We design online environments, immersive installations and objects.

Our primary medium is 3D scanning, a form of machine vision that we argue is the future of photography and much more beyond. As the electronic eyes for billions of mobile phones and driverless vehicles 3D scanners are the cartographers of the future. By critically observing places and events through the eyes of these machines our work hopes to glance at the future we will all inhabit.

Founded in 2010, we have worked with leading architects, broadcasters, scientists and artists from across the world. ScanLAB operate from concept, through on location scanning, to delivered product. Our work has featured in major TV documentaries and cinema screenings, been widely published and exhibited internationally.

## 【完成】YouTube——UCL ScanLAB

Where you will find a lot of robots, CNC machines, 3D printers, welding kit and most importantly a lot of excited young students engaging with Design for Manufacturing tomorrow in the built environment, every day since opening on 9th January 2018 has been interesting ... .

A new film by ScanLAB Projects with soundtrack composed by Pascal Wyse showcases UCL's new space at Here East.

The film shows the transformation of UCL’s 6,000 sqm space at Here East, which features a 330-seat multi-functional auditorium and a 2,000 sqm robotics and advanced prototyping space developed with UCL Robotics Institute. It allows us to see the diverse range of acitivities taking place in the teaching and studio spaces, workshops and laboratories, with staff and students working with robots and fabrication equipment, as well as environmental chambers and test rigs.

ScanLAB used large-scale 3D scanning technology, and had unlimited access to every studio, lab, lecture room and cupboard, allowing them to capture a total of 225 scans across a week of scanning.

The result is an amazingly detailed digital replica of UCL's new Here East campus, capturing a cloud of over 11 billion precisely measured points and assembling them into a virtual model. Each scan had an average of around 50 million data positions.

The Bartlett and the Faculty of Engineering Sciences expanded into premises at Here East on Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in early 2018, designed by leading architects Hawkins\Brown.

UCL's space at Here East is being used to undertake ground-breaking research in areas including architecture, infrastructure, transport, robotics, healthcare, manufacturing, and environmental measurement. UCL has also developed new degree programmes in creative design, using film and performance as well as robotic and networked screen technologies.
