## 【完成】3D Geological Modelling

Plain surface and Complex Conditions

**How to Build a Spatial Database** **——参考论文** **_《A boundary and voxel-based 3D geological data management system leveraging BIM and GIS_** **_》_**

Starting with a subsurface geospatial database, the geometry (points, lines, and surfaces), SQL storage, and interpretation operations are partially to be determined. These first-generation management systems were designed to meet the needs of the user where all the required data were in the user's organizational domain.

They were proprietary, stand-alone systems built specifically to handle spatial data, i.e., the coupling between the application and the flat file was very high, and there was no data independence of the spatial data in the flat file.
