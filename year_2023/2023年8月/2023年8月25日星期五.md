基于诱导点的高效随机场建模

**Inducing-point approximations of Gaussian processes****：**Random field modeling based on a GP elegantly estimates the uncertainty of geotechnical properties by learning intricate moment functions from datasets **_through flexible and expressive kernels_**. However, the inference from large datasets and the sampling with fine resolution is computationally demanding due to the dense matrix operation. Various sparse approximations are proposed to overcome this limitation.
