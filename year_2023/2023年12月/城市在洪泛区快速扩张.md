全球气候变暖背景下，极端气候事件频发，对经济社会发展造成了严重的负面影响。城市由于经济发展程度较高、人口众多，也是受到极端事件影响最大的区域。目前全球仍然处于快速城市化的过程中，而未来城市发展如何应对气候变化也成为了每个城市都面临的挑战。洪水给城市居民生命财产安全带来了巨大的威胁，在快速城市化过程中，城市的发展已经慢慢向原来的洪泛区延伸，但是目前还没有研究系统评估全球城市对于洪水的暴露度及其变化趋势。

过去几十年快速城市化过程中，不受洪水影响的区域开发之后，城市的发展只能慢慢向河床或者洪泛区扩张，比如越南的Quảng Nam以及泰国的曼谷。

作者利用高分辨率遥感数据研究了全球城市的发展及其对洪水暴露度的变化趋势。结果表明，1985年以来全球不管是大城市还是乡村，都在向洪泛区快速扩张。2015年全球至少有11.3%的城市建成区面临严重或极严重的洪水危害，也就是说，这些区域在百年一遇的洪水事件中，淹没深度至少达到 50 厘米。

全球很多地区的城市在洪泛区的扩张远远高于非洪泛区，其中以东亚地区最为严重，城市在洪泛区扩张速度比非洪泛区高了60%。1985年至2015 年间，中国的城区面积增加了165%，其中面临洪灾高风险的城区面积增加了 223%。

最后作者指出，虽然全球不同地区城市遭遇洪水的风险差异较大，但是很多地区仍然没有采取有效的预防和应对措施，使得极端气候事件的暴露度仍在增加。

Disaster losses are increasing and evidence is mounting that climate change is driving up the probability of extreme natural shocks[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06468-9#ref-CR1 "Schiermeier, Q. Droughts, heatwaves and floods: how to tell when climate change is to blame. Nature 560, 20–22 (2018)."),[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06468-9#ref-CR2 "Otto, F. et al. The attribution question. Nat. Clim. Change 6, 813–816 (2016)."),[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06468-9#ref-CR3 "Philip, S. et al. A protocol for probabilistic extreme event attribution analyses. Adv. Stat. Climatol. Meteorol. Oceanogr. 6, 177–203 (2020)."). Yet it has also proved politically expedient to invoke climate change as an exogenous force that supposedly places disasters beyond the influence of local and national authorities[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06468-9#ref-CR4 "Raju, E., Boyd, E. & Otto, F. Stop blaming the climate for disasters. Commun. Earth Environ. 3, 1 (2022)."),[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06468-9#ref-CR5 "Lahsen, M. & Ribot, J. Politics of attributing extreme events and disasters to climate change. Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. Clim. Change 13, e750 (2022)."). However, locally determined patterns of urbanization and spatial development are key factors to the exposure and vulnerability of people to climatic shocks[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06468-9#ref-CR6 "Hallegatte, S., Vogt-Schilb, A., Bangalore, M. & Rozenberg, J. Unbreakable: Building the Resilience of the Poor in the Face of Natural Disasters (World Bank, 2017)."). Using high-resolution annual data, this study shows that, since 1985, human settlements around the world—from villages to megacities—have expanded continuously and rapidly into present-day flood zones. In many regions, growth in the most hazardous flood zones is outpacing growth in non-exposed zones by a large margin, particularly in East Asia, where high-hazard settlements have expanded 60% faster than flood-safe settlements. These results provide systematic evidence of a divergence in the exposure of countries to flood hazards. Instead of adapting their exposure, many countries continue to actively amplify their exposure to increasingly frequent climatic shocks.

The world’s cities are growing rapidly as people from peripheral regions move in search of economic opportunities[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06468-9#ref-CR7 "Tellman, B. et al. Satellite imaging reveals increased proportion of population exposed to floods. Nature 596, 80–86 (2021)."). Urbanization and economic development have traditionally gone hand in hand as cities enable agglomeration economies[8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06468-9#ref-CR8 "Henderson, J. V. Cities and development. J. Reg. Sci. 50, 515–540 (2010)."), for instance, by matching employers and job seekers, sellers and buyers, and capital and projects, and supporting productive infrastructure such as public transport systems[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06468-9#ref-CR9 "Rosenthal, S. S. & Strange, W. C. in Handbook of Regional and Urban Economics Vol. 4 (eds Henderson, J. V. & Thisse, J.-F.) 2119–2171 (Elsevier, 2004)."),[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06468-9#ref-CR10 "Duranton, G. & Puga, D. in Handbook of Regional and Urban Economics Vol. 4 (eds Henderson, J. V. & Thisse, J.-F.) 2063–2117 (2004).").

However, rapid urban growth can also cause congestion effects; for instance, by increasing exposure to natural hazards and pressure on public services and infrastructure. This is particularly relevant in low-income and middle-income countries that lack the capacity for risk-informed urban and infrastructure planning and the resources to invest in transport and protection infrastructure. Moreover, spaces that are safe from floods are increasingly occupied and the resulting land scarcity can drive new developments disproportionately into previously avoided areas, including riverbeds and floodplains (Fig. [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06468-9#Fig1)).

Despite the increasing interplay between rapid urbanization trends and flood disasters, the lack of high-resolution flood-hazard maps and annual settlement footprint data has been a key factor limiting systematic analysis of global flood-exposure trends[11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06468-9#ref-CR11 "Neumann, B., Vafeidis, A. T., Zimmermann, J. & Nicholls, R. J. Future coastal population growth and exposure to sea-level rise and coastal flooding - a global assessment. PLoS One 10, e0118571 (2015)."). By using historical records of flood events, such as EM-DAT, studies have estimated exposure indicators at the country level[12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06468-9#ref-CR12 "Peduzzi, P., Dao, H., Herold, C. & Mouton, F. Assessing global exposure and vulnerability towards natural hazards: the Disaster Risk Index. Nat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. 9, 1149–1159 (2009)."). However, lacking information on the spatial distribution of flood hazards and populations means that continuously evolving urban shapes cannot be taken into account accurately, thus making flood exposure difficult to compare over time[11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06468-9#ref-CR11 "Neumann, B., Vafeidis, A. T., Zimmermann, J. & Nicholls, R. J. Future coastal population growth and exposure to sea-level rise and coastal flooding - a global assessment. PLoS One 10, e0118571 (2015)."),[13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06468-9#ref-CR13 "de Bruijn, J. A. et al. A global database of historic and real-time flood events based on social media. Sci. Data 6, 311 (2019)."),[14](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06468-9#ref-CR14 "Muis, S., Verlaan, M., Winsemius, H. C., Aerts, J. C. & Ward, P. J. A global reanalysis of storm surges and extreme sea levels. Nat. Commun. 7, 11969 (2016)."). A study based on satellite imagery from 2000 to 2018 offered important insights on the growing populations affected by floods[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06468-9#ref-CR7 "Tellman, B. et al. Satellite imaging reveals increased proportion of population exposed to floods. Nature 596, 80–86 (2021)."). Although such imagery can detect many past floods, it does not shed light on the underlying spatial expansion and exposure patterns of all human settlements. The number of people who were affected by floods between 2000 and 2018 represents a small share of the overall at-risk populations[15](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06468-9#ref-CR15 "Rentschler, J., Salhab, M. & Jafino, B. A. Flood exposure and poverty in 188 countries. Nat. Commun. 13, 3527 (2022).").

Owing to data limitations, past studies also focus on certain types of flood, rather than assessing the combined hazards from all flood types (that is, fluvial, pluvial and coastal flooding)[11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06468-9#ref-CR11 "Neumann, B., Vafeidis, A. T., Zimmermann, J. & Nicholls, R. J. Future coastal population growth and exposure to sea-level rise and coastal flooding - a global assessment.

Environ. Res. Lett. 17, 104024 (2022)."). Others assess hazards for a subset of countries, falling short of full global coverage[19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06468-9#ref-CR19 "Smith, A. et al. New estimates of flood exposure in developing countries using high-resolution population data. Nat.

Econ. 12, 35–66 (2020)."). Similarly, studies using relatively coarse spatial resolution flood-hazard data tend to inaccurately represent principal floodplains, thus underestimating exposure[19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06468-9#ref-CR19 "Smith, A. et al. New estimates of flood exposure in developing countries using high-resolution population data. Nat.

Sci. Total Environ. 817, 153012 (2022).").

This study makes several contributions. First, by considering flood-exposure trends with annual frequency, it demonstrates the value of continuous monitoring of evolving flood exposure. Second, it distinguishes the growth dynamics of flood-exposed versus flood-safe spatial development to document a divergence in flood exposure—regions that are either increasing or decreasing exposure as they urbanize. Third, rather than focusing on a certain flood type, it combines different flood types and assesses overall exposure. Fourth, by using high-resolution global datasets, it documents trends with complete global coverage and within one consistent methodology. Last, by estimating spatially disaggregated trends of urbanization and flood exposure, it offers concrete evidence to policymakers for prioritizing measures in risk prevention, reduction and preparedness.
