# 前言

城市形态的概念在变化，作为普遍规范的假设也在变化，但我们无法对这些假设进行检验。

# [[Heuristic Design]] 启发式设计

The use of data guiding the development of cities is in itself nothing new. When Dr John Snow, a London physician, sought the source of cholera in London in 1854, he traced it to a water pump in Broad Street. Likewise, Ebenezer Howard, founder of the Garden City movement in England, assigned odorous industrial activities downwind of residential areas. Codiﬁed into zoning laws and building controls, these same principles are evident everywhere. While codiﬁed practices might address some problems, we know they also generate others, as their consequences are not modelled.

With digital tools it is obvious that data can underpin design. For example, cities seek to reduce energy consumption by improving buildings and neighbourhoods. We have become more aware of the health consequences of choices in building settlements. Epidemiologists are increasingly engaged to promote the design of healthy neighbourhoods, such as addressing walkability, and thus exercise and health.

在这里，城市部门在不灵活的控制下迅速扩张，以产生统一的建筑形式。特别需要注意的是，在每个平屋顶的顶部都有额外的居住地，这是一个不受控制的适应性发展的例子。

# The Data Tsunami

Smart cities rely on well-planned infrastructure to avoid capacity constraints. Future planning is better served by comprehensive data across infrastructure in place, ownership and capacities. Even well-established cities are challenged by incremental historic implementations, as seen here in Delhi. 智慧城市依赖于规划良好的基础设施，以避免能力限制。全面的数据能更好地为未来规划提供依据，这些数据涵盖了现有的基础设施、所有权和容量。即使是历史悠久的城市，也面临着历史性渐进实施的挑战，德里的情况就是如此。

The concept of urban data seems clear. What happens within a metropolitan boundary is urban data. Data relevant to urban development may be found from many sources, from the benign to the contentious.There are intentional records (such as trafﬁc counts and tax records); there are ephemeral data (Twitter feeds) and inferred data (from analysing images). Increasingly, much is released as open data by institutions and governments responding to demands for accountability and transparency. 城市数据的概念似乎很明确。在大都市范围内发生的事情就是城市数据。与城市发展相关的数据有很多来源，从善意的到有争议的。有有意的记录（如交通流量统计和纳税记录）；有短暂的数据（Twitter 消息）和推断的数据（通过分析图像）。越来越多的机构和政府为了响应问责制和透明度的要求，以开放数据的形式发布了大量数据。

未来的挑战是，我们如何促进城市作为弹性自组织系统的演变，并利用数据来实现这一点。

By integrating data, it is possible to visualise walkability and plan interventions to improve possible health outcomes, and to analyse consequences before implementing changes. The image here was generated in AURIN using data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Queensland Government Department of Education andTraining, and OpenStreet Maps.

# 数据价值

The value of data, however, lies in its accuracy, consistency and reliability, and ethical application.

While some data are available as open access, access to most data of value must be negotiated.This is a sometimes lengthy and tedious process requiring legal expertise. In 2010, the Australian Government funded the development of a data portal, now known as AURIN, to aid data access for researchers to inform policy-making and implementation, including urban design. 虽然有些数据可以开放获取，但大多数有价值的数据必须通过谈判才能获取。这有时是一个漫长而繁琐的过程，需要法律专业知识。2010 年，澳大利亚政府资助开发了一个数据门户网站，即现在的 AURIN，以帮助研究人员获取数据，为包括城市设计在内的政策制定和实施提供信息。

Conceived and proposed by the University of Melbourne, this unique national portal now provides access to an evergrowing catalogue of rich datasets (currently over 5,000 sets), handling all negotiation, correction, cataloguing and access control to make it easier for researchers and designers to ﬁnd quality data quickly. 这个独特的国家门户网站由墨尔本大学构思并提出，现在可以访问不断增长的丰富数据集目录（目前超过 5,000 套），处理所有协商、校正、编目和访问控制工作，使研究人员和设计人员更容易快速找到优质数据。

It is clear that we are experiencing a data tsunami as smart devices proliferate and systems are interconnected.The practice of architecture and urban design will evolve to embrace the opportunities that data access brings. Examples abound of advantages gained by those who apply data to their industry.  很明显，随着智能设备的普及和系统之间的相互连接，我们正在经历一场数据海啸。将数据应用于其行业并获得优势的例子比比皆是。

For such uses, data has to be veriﬁed, cleaned and aligned before interpretation; the data tsunami can be an inundation of rubbish. From data, we obtain information from which we can build knowledge and hence postulate consequences of action. Its use must therefore be underpinned by theory; data itself is insufﬁcient. In data terms, a smart city is not a technological problem, but a theoretical challenge. 对于这些用途，数据在解释之前必须经过验证、清理和调整；数据海啸可能是垃圾的泛滥。我们从数据中获取信息，并据此建立知识，进而推测行动的后果。因此，数据的使用必须以理论为基础；数据本身是不够的。就数据而言，智慧城市不是一个技术问题，而是一个理论挑战。

Data portals such as AURIN can support policy formulation as well as design exploration.This image is the Brisbane ﬂood overlay, generated in AURIN using data from Brisbane City Council and the Queensland Government Department of Natural Resources, Mines and Energy. AURIN 等数据门户网站可为政策制定和设计探索提供支持。这张图片是布里斯班的洪水叠加图，由 AURIN 利用布里斯班市政府和昆士兰州政府自然资源、矿产和能源部提供的数据生成。

Resilient urban systems allow for incremental development according to need and capacity. In place of planning-led change, many settlements evolve as resources become available, housing expands and land uses shift, led by demand. 具有复原力的城市系统可以根据需求和能力逐步发展。许多住区的发展不是以规划为主导的变革，而是随着资源的增加、住房的扩大和土地用途的转变，在需求的引导下不断发展。

# The Need for Theory

Cities are evolving systems. Data can support modelling to develop planning and design strategies to allow for evolution. The layers seen here in Hong Kong span a century of change. 城市是不断发展的系统。数据可以支持建模，从而制定规划和设计战略，以适应不断变化的环境。这里所看到的香港城市图层跨越了一个世纪的变化。

The application of data in examining urban futures is at a rudimentary stage.There are few theories and fewer tools. Architects and urban designers must be centrally involved in the development of such theories and their application in design.7 Just as architectural education has embraced scripting,8 so too must it engage with data analytics. If we ignore this opportunity, the practices of design will be diminished. Data scientists have already gained ground in the ﬁeld – the contract awarded to Sidewalk Labs (ie Google) to design a sector of Toronto is a signal.

City leaders understand that data will underpin urban management and development in the future. As cities install ever more sensors and release data generated by other sources as open data, it may be assumed that urban futures can be realised purely by data modelling. A data-driven urban strategy is highly attractive and increasingly feasible. A service industry is developing using AI to mine data and support decision-making.The quality of cities will decline, however, if urban design transforms to a technical practice of data analytics.

The urban design community has a choice.The professional roles of architects and urban designers have been eroded over past decades as digital capabilities have arrived and not been embraced; we have been sidelined. If we fail to rise to the data challenge, our roles will diminish further, and a decade from now designers will be working in two dimensions (or more likely, 2.5D) from speciﬁcations provided by data analysts. Or we can engage with relevant data to propose 4D frameworks for evolving communities.

Data alone is insufﬁcient, but clients may value data capabilities over design since they are themselves driven by quantitative metrics, and designers are unable to converse in their terms. Interpreting data into design strategies for human beneﬁt demands design skills of integration and insight. Designers who are data literate can engage with these issues and pre-empt the data miners.

Cities are evolving systems. Data can support modelling to develop planning and design strategies to allow for evolution.The layers seen here in Hong Kong span a century of change.
