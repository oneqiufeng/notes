注意到GD、AD、PD的辨析...
The increased computational capacity of tools and the diversity of the available CD methods have enabled architects to enhance the design process, either by making it more efﬁcient or by expanding its conceptual boundaries. These methods empower architects to (i) explore and evaluate other complex solutions, (ii) create and deploy advanced fabrication techniques, and (iii) control the design process at different stages remarkably. Thus, the question is no longer whether CD is good or bad for architecture (Picon, 2010) but rather how can the discipline beneﬁt from it.
