智慧园区的建设已经比较普遍，但以城市信息模型（City Information Model，CIM）平台为“数字底座”的园区智慧化建设案例并不多。事实上，CIM平台对园区的精细化管理具有重要意义。从CIM技术的发展和应用状况入手，提出基于CIM的智慧园区整体设计思路，并阐述了应用与发展建议。

The construction of smart parks has become more common, but there are not enough cases of smart park construction with the City Information Model platform as the "digital base". 

In fact, the CIM platform is of great significance to the refinement of park management. Starting from the development and application status of CIM technology, we propose the overall design idea of CIM-based smart park and elaborate the application and development suggestions.

防灾减灾领域的应用：在建筑密度较高的老城区，城市更新应当根据人口密度和服务距离，通过必要的拆建增加室外避灾场所；在范围较大，道路条件较差的更新地区，要开辟最低限度的消防、救援与疏散道路；对于地势低洼、排水设施不完善的地区，要重视提高场地和建筑的防内涝能力；对人口密度较高的地区，应开展传染病疫情的安全性分析，结合更新降低疾病传染风险；对工业区的功能性更新，必须对建成环境和土壤进行污染评估，开展必要的生态修复。此外，应全面评估、排查城市供气、供水、排水、供电等各类市政基础设施的安全隐患，在城市更新中进行设施改造和风险排除。

In old urban areas with high building density, urban renewal should increase outdoor disaster shelters through necessary demolition and construction according to population density and service distance.

In renewal areas with larger scope and poor road conditions, minimum firefighting, rescue, and evacuation roads should be opened.

For areas with low-lying terrain and imperfect drainage facilities, attention should be paid to improving the anti-flooding capacity of sites and buildings.

For areas with high population density, carry out safety analysis of infectious disease epidemics and reduce the risk of disease transmission in combination with renewal.

For functional renewal of industrial areas, pollution assessment of the built environment and soil must be conducted and necessary ecological restoration should be carried out. 

In addition, the safety hazards of various municipal infrastructures such as urban gas supply, water supply, drainage and power supply should be comprehensively assessed and investigated, and facility renovation and risk elimination should be carried out in urban renewal.

# Four eras of CIM

Back in 2008 during the optimization of the Shanghai World Expo program, academician Wu Zhiqiang, as chief planner, was the first in the world to propose the concept of CIM, which is the prototype of CIM 1.0, when the system for the command and management of the park was completed and implemented and used in the 2010 Shanghai World Expo; in 2012, a wisdom system for urban multi-departmental collaboration was added and the mayor's decision table was developed to realize the jump from 1.0 to 2.0 of the wisdom hub; in 2016, the CIM platform of Beijing sub-center was developed to add the iterative optimization technology for public facilities configuration to support the balance of urban resources allocation and functions, and upgraded to CIM3.0.
韧性城市是指具有吸收未来对其社会经济、技术系统和基础设施造成冲击和压力的能力，同时仍能基本维持相同功能结构、系统和身份的城市。韧性城市需具备防灾能力、救灾能力和恢复能力，发展韧性城市需要让城市能够提前预防并减轻灾害，能及时应对并适应灾害，能迅速从灾害中恢复。

Resilient cities are cities that have the capacity to absorb future shocks and stresses on their socio-economic and technological systems and infrastructure, while still maintaining essentially the same functional structure, systems and identity. Resilient cities need to be able to prevent, respond and recover from disasters. Developing resilient cities requires enabling cities to prevent and mitigate disasters in advance, to respond and adapt to disasters in a timely manner, and to recover quickly from disasters.

湖北省CIM平台的建设实践：构建包括基础地理信息、建筑物、基础设施三维模型等的CIM平台基础数据库，一数一源，互通共享。在底图上将全市所有保障房、商品房、拆迁安置、危房改造、公积金、物业服务等数据进行叠加展示，进行多维度综合分析。

Construction Practice of CIM Platform in Hubei Province：Build the basic database of CIM platform including basic geographic information, buildings, and infrastructure 3D models, etc. 

One source with the only number, to achieve the interoperability and sharing. 

On the base map, all the data of the city's protected housing, commercial housing, demolition and resettlement, dangerous housing renovation, provident fund and property service are overlaid and displayed for multi-dimensional comprehensive analysis.

研究结果显示，CIM生态系统的创新分析视角是基于机构和社会技术系统的多阶概念；CIM应用的潜力取决于快速的技术发展和本地培训；而局限性则与公共权力的能力有关，以使实际解决方案的应用、纳入和实施。

The findings show that the innovative analytical perspective of the CIM ecosystem is based on a multi-order concept of institutional and socio-technical systems; the potential of CIM applications depends on rapid technological development and local training; and the limitations are related to the capacity of public authorities to enable the application, incorporation and implementation of practical solutions.

结论是，在城市管理和规划中实施城市三维模型可以使地方政府受益，并在一定程度上起到强化作用，因为它克服了阻碍创新扩散过程的现有做法。调查以多案例研究为基础，分为两个主要阶段。

It is concluded that the implementation of urban 3D models(U3DM) in urban management and planning can benefit and to some extent reinforce local governments, as it overcomes existing practices that hinder the innovation diffusion process. The investigation is based on a multi-case study and is divided into two main phases.

第一阶段是描述性的，以文献和书目研究为支持，同时与城市研究和城市规划研究所的地理地学、自然资源相关部门负责人进行访谈。在第一阶段，建立描述性表格记录案例。

The first phase was descriptive, supported by literature and bibliographic research, as well as interviews with the heads of departments related to geography and natural resources at the Institute of Urban Studies and Urban Planning. In the first phase, descriptive tables were created to record the cases.

第二阶段是分析性的，它与文献中的第一个结果交叉和对抗。讨论的分析结构基于3DCM和CIM等工具使用中的潜在潜力；以及在从这些潜力中提取最大值的搜索中存在的挑战和限制。

The second phase is analytical and it crosses and confronts the first results in the literature. The analytical structure discussed is based on the potential potentials in the use of tools such as 3DCM and CIM, and the challenges and limitations in the search for extracting maxima from these potentials.

CIM &BIM&GIS（Set as the Introduction）

城市信息模型的概念将BIM对建筑完整信息数字化建模，用于设计、施工、使用、维护全生命周期管理的概念，扩展到了城市领域。

The concept of City Information Modeling (CIM, City Information Modeling) extends the BIM concept of digitally modeling the complete information of a building for the whole life cycle management of design, construction, use and maintenance to the urban field.

在空间范围和技术逻辑上，CIM的建设是“大场景的GIS数据+小场景的BIM数据+物联网”的有机结合，依托海量数据建立全面的数字孪生模型是智慧城市中台最核心的能力。

In terms of spatial scope and technical logic, the construction of CIM is the organic combination of "large-scene GIS data + small-scene BIM data + Internet of Things", and the establishment of a comprehensive digital twin model based on massive data is the most core capability of the smart city center.

BIM是“建筑信息模型”的缩写，过去是平面图纸、现在是在电脑里搭建三维立体模型，可以提前发现设计、施工问题。有了BIM模型，建设前，可以模拟施工，提前发现问题并干预，实现事前管控，减少建设隐患。例：智汇云通过BIM技术建立了一套与真实建筑一一对应的数字资产，将成为未来几十年运营维护的“电子档案”，对城市中各个建筑做到构件尺度的数字孪生，促进了建筑物的信息数字化；GIS技术则能够对城市尺度上的地形地貌、土地利用等宏观空间环境特征和人群特征、信息资金流动等城市中无形的社会经济活动信息进行结构化、历史性的储存。

BIM is the abbreviation of "Building Information Model", which used to be a flat drawing, but now it is a three-dimensional model built in the computer, so that design and construction problems can be found in advance. With BIM model, construction can be simulated before construction, so that problems can be found and intervened in advance to achieve prior control and reduce construction hazards.

Example: Zhihui cloud through BIM technology to establish a set of digital assets corresponding to the real building, will become the future decades of operation and maintenance of the "electronic file", the city of each building to achieve the scale of the components of the digital twin, to promote the digitization of building information; GIS technology is able to the city scale topography, land use and other macro spatial environmental characteristics and GIS technology is able to structure and historically store the information of invisible socio-economic activities in the city, such as topography, land use and other macro spatial environmental characteristics, as well as the characteristics of the population and the flow of information and capital.

而物联网技术通过城市传感器的广泛布设，一方面可以对BIM中建筑物的运营数据进行补充，更重要的是对交通流、大气水文等城市开放空间中的微观环境变化进行实时感知和收集。

The IoT technology, through the extensive deployment of urban sensors, can complement the operational data of buildings in BIM on the one hand, and more importantly, provide real-time sensing and collection of traffic flow, atmospheric hydrology, and other micro-environmental changes in urban open space.

BIM与GIS在空间范围上互补，数据结构上共通，每栋建筑可以看作GIS中的一个地物，每一根管道、路灯等城市基础设施也可看作BIM的一个构件。在此基础上嵌入物联网数据，又大大提升了数据空间和时间粒度的细化程度，实现对城市空间精细、全面、动态、实时的数字化。

BIM and GIS are complementary in spatial scope and common in data structure. Each building can be regarded as a feature in GIS, and each pipeline, street light and other urban infrastructure can be regarded as a building block of BIM. Embedding IoT data on this basis greatly enhances the refinement of data space and time granularity, and realizes fine, comprehensive, dynamic and real-time digitization of urban space.

在全面收集数据的基础上，CIM通过统一的数据平台将各领域不同维度的数据进行结构化、标准化整合。

On the basis of comprehensive data collection, CIM integrates data of different dimensions in various fields in a structured and standardized manner through a unified data platform.

一方面实现城市级数据的可计算，对任意空间范围内的建筑面积、容积率等空间指标和人口密度、车辆密度甚至用水用电量等社会经济指标进行统计分析，并可通过机器学习和仿真模拟挖掘规律、进行预测。

On the one hand, the city-level data can be calculated, and the spatial indicators such as building area, floor area ratio, and socio-economic indicators such as population density, vehicle density and even water and electricity consumption in any spatial area can be statistically analyzed, and the laws can be mined and predicted through machine learning and simulation.

另一方面通过空间信息可视化的技术，使得城市数据能够与其空间位置实时对应，一目了然，便于运维和管理人员的迅速感知和决策。

On the other hand, through the technology of spatial information visualization, the city data can correspond to its spatial location in real time and can be understood at a glance, which facilitates rapid perception and decision making of operation and management personnel.

此外，CIM平台还具有开放性，经授权后可以向政府、企业和学界提供数据接口，成为城市级应用开发的“土地供给”，使得数据能够产生更大的社会和经济价值。

然而在软件层面，目前我们还并没有一个真正的CIM产品。市面上的GIS和BIM厂商，很多都基于自己的产品延伸扩展，同时具备了GIS和BIM的能力，但这些产品除了满足住建系统规、建、管等传统三维空间数据需求以外，对智慧城市更全面的需求并不能很好满足。

随着5G和物联网技术的普及，一些技术厂商已经认识到全新CIM架构的价值，并采用“时空数据库+时空数据引擎+时空网格体系”等技术体系构建全新的CIM系统。

In addition, the CIM platform is open and can be authorized to provide data interfaces to government, enterprises, and academia, becoming a "land supply" for city-level application development, enabling the data to generate greater social and economic value.

However, at the software level, we do not have a real CIM product yet. GIS and BIM manufacturers on the market, many are based on their own product extensions, while having the ability to GIS and BIM, but these products in addition to meet the housing system regulations, construction, management and other traditional three-dimensional spatial data needs, the more comprehensive needs of the smart city is not well met.

With the popularity of 5G and Internet of Things technology, some technology vendors have recognized the value of the new CIM architecture, and the use of "space-time database + space-time data engine + space-time grid system" and other technical systems to build a new CIM system.
